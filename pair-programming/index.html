          <p>Notice the space between them. It occurs because of my carriage return in the HTML which I've used to keep the code oragnized. I've used a rest to insure no elements should have any default margins or padding. (I did add a bottom margin to amke it easier to read.) This space is actually a space character rendered just as it would be between two inline elements.</p>

          <p>You can see that, even though the elements are spaced in the code, the space is not actually rendered on the page. This may not be a huge deal in these forst examples, but...</p>
